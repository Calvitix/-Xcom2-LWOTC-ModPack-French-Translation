DescriptionEntry="FNORD (Subject to future Edits or a likely rewrite)\n\nI first saw the things from a distance, during the disastrous Operation Doom Slap, a perfectly auspicious name for a mission, I know, Bradford couldn't have picked something more fitting. Anyway. The two monsters were patrolling the vicinity of ADVENT Blacksite Twelve, and each of them had a squad of Taipans tailing behind them. Even from afar, I could feel their ominious presence, the monsters we now know as Titans. At The Squad Leader, Ramirez's Signal, I tried to put a bullet through the obviously Psionic monster's head. And that's when everything went to hell. \n\n- Excerpt from Corporal Dee's Debriefing in the wake of Operation Doom Slap.\n\nSergeant Ramirez opened fire with his Shredder Gun. Corporal Rusty Dios, one of the Skirmishers who had recently joined our team, and I, Squaddie Grenadier Krystal Carnahan, lobbed a series of grenades, and it was then, that I realized how utterly outclasseded we were. Faced with weapons that would make quick work of Mutons and even ADVENT's Heavily Armored Shieldbearers, the things didn't even care. The Shredder gun barely injured them, while all the grenades did was seemingly make them more angry. Corporal Dios's quick thinking saved all of us. Who survived, I mean. Grabbing me with one arm, he launched the two of us to the roof of the ADVENT Facility, even as the Taipans began to lay down suppressing fire on The Squad Leader. Corporal Dios and I began firing every grenade we had on us down at the snakes, trying to buy our Squad Leader Time. Unfortunately, time wasn't on our side. The Titans had no fear of grenades, and seemed to bear a grudge against Squad Leader Ramirez for having blasted them with his Shredder gun. Firing as fast as we could at the approaching Titans in the hopes we might hold them off long enough for him to run, Squad Leader Ramirez.. He panicked. He tried to run, and one of the Taipans shot him in the leg. And then the Titan caught up. I don't know what exactly how Squad Leader Ramirez died, I had to duck behind cover as a Taipan blasted my position with a burst of gunfire, but I felt as much as I saw it when he died. A massive scintillating dome of violet light blew apart the rock formation he had been using as cover, and then the beasts turned their attention to us, myself and Corporal Dios. With an earth-shaking roar that lit up the sky with a burst of psionic energy, they charged towards us, their Psionic Power and unholy presence washing over us. I could feel it. How much they hated us. Hated everything.. As the Titans pulled themselves onto the roof of the Facility, Corporal Dios primed his X4 Charges, threw them down, slung one arm around my waist and pointed his grapple into the air. In the next moment, as The Taipans climbed up the walls, Corporal Dios laughed, and launched his grapple as I heard the familiar roar of Firebrand's engines. And then we were off the roof, flying through the air at breakneck speed, as the charges detonated. I almost fell for him then and there, honestly speaking. After that.. We picked up our Sharpshooter, Corporal Dee, who also managed to survive.. But she said, despite everything, those massive cyborg berserkers were still moving. Battered and bloody, but definitely still alive. \n\n-Excerpt from Squaddie Carnahan's Debriefing in the wake of Operation Doom Slap."

[RequiemTaipan X2UFOpediaTemplate]
DescriptionEntry="Seductive. Sensual. Senpentine. Taipans. Having proven to be as popular among XCOM's more questionable recruits as they are deadly, the Taipans are an existence of much frustration for Central Officer Bradford, who tasked myself and Intelligence Officer Audrey Bellamy, who he called responsible women he can trust, with figuring out a method to counter the Alien Propaganda that he dubbed as 'Snitty Snakes' in the wake of Corporal Grenadier Landon 'Snake Charmer' Pierce's infamous tryst with a Taipan, who he referred to as a lovely lady by the name Tal'Ssssha Ssshaynalisss, while infiltrating a Gene Therapy Clinic in New London's staff. Which forced the Operation to be aborted and earned himself four weeks in the medical bay to treat his severe injuries. To make matters worse, he stirred up severe chaos among the younger male members of the crew after having declared it the best lay of his life and that he'd do it again if he got the chance.\n\nWhen asking Doctor Tygan for advice, he suggested that the girls of the crew do a bikini photoshoot, to remind the young idiots what they're fighting for. This of course, was immediately rejected by Chief Engineer Shen, who began arguing with Tygan, only to be interrupted by the Avenger's Emergency Deployment Alarm.\n\nADVENT was attacking Funky Town, a nearby Resistance Haven. And of course, myself and Audrey were selected to deploy, together with the 'Snake Charmer' himself, The Templar, known as Cloista The Shadowblade, Spark Unit Zelfana Zero Zero One, and the weird Alien Cyborg, The Proxian, known as Alpha.\n\nUpon landing on the ground, we were immediately intercepted by two ADVENT Squads. The first squad was a group of eight ADVENT Troopers led by a Taipan Dragoon, the other, five Stun Lancers led by a Taipan Fusilier. While Zelfana and Alpha battled the Fusilier and the Stun Lancers, myself, Audrey, and Cloista took on the Troopers and Dragoon in an intense fire fight. And then of course, when Landon stepped out to launch a grenade, the Fusilier shot him. With 'Snake Charmer' downed and bleeding out, no longer able to provide suppresion fire the Dragoon began launching its Corrosive Kosma Grenades at us.\n\nHad it not been for the timely intervention of the Skirmishers and the Haven's Militia, who attacked the Taipan Dragoon from its flank, it may have been the end for us. Together with the Skirmishers and the Militia, we held the line, but despite our best efforts, and that of the Militia, we were outnumbered and heavily outgunned, with more ADVENT and Taipans advancing towards our position. We were forced to book a hasty retreat, together with the survivors, and Corporal Landon, who we managed to save. \n\nIn the end, Bradford praised us for our outstanding effort in the face of overwhelming odds, that we had rescued more people than he had expected we would be able to, and presented Audrey with a medal for having been the most valuable person on the mission.\n\n Update - I am going to strangle Snake Charmer one of these days if Bradford doesn't first. The bastard's first words after regaining consciousness was that he was going to screw the damn snake that shot him the next time he sees her.\n\n - From the Personal Log of Sergeant Riley 'Medusa' Reid"

DescriptionEntry="I can still hear them, you know? Whenever I close my eyes, I can still hear them. Their servos, their footsteps, the sounds of alien war machines, marching across the earth. The gnashing of their jaws, and the crunching of human bones. Civilian, combatant, surrendering, begging, it didn't matter to the aliens at all. Wave after wave, they launched canisters of some kind of.. Chemical. Where they landed, they dispersed into a thick, dark, fog that shimmered in the wind, like it was full of little violet stars. Everyone it blew over died, dissolving into ribbons of pink light.. If only that was the end of things. Those nightmares came from the fog, searching for survivors..\n\nHow did I survive? I was.. I was lucky, I guess.. They gathered us all together, and then.. Then.. They started with the children. One at a time, the aliens.. The aliens ate them. They opened up their armor, and the bugs.. They looked.. They looked like chryssalids. But different from any I had seen before.. The bugs reached out from their mechs, and slowly ate them. Alive. They took their time. Leisurely.. Once.. Once they were done with the children, they continued, working their way up from the youngest.. It.. It felt like years before my turn came. I was almost relieved. But then.. I heard a voice, and the thing let go of me.\n\nA tall.. Man, alien, I don't know what he was. With blue skin, black and violet eyes, and a horrifying maw of fangs. He had a hood, armor, and an enormous rifle slung over his back. He grabbed me by the chin, looked me over, and licked the tears off my cheek. He spoke to me. Called me a pretty little thing, said that it'd be a shame if I went to waste.. Said he needed to send a message, and.. And that it wouldn't be good if there wasn't anyone to tell you what happened. So.. He.. He made me watch. Watch as the bugs ate everyone else.. One by one. At the end, he patted my head, and called me a good girl. Told me that when I meet the great heroes of XCOM.. I need to.. I need to tell you.. To tell you that you're invited to dinner. As the entrée.\n\n- From The Debriefing of Lavinia Rockfeller, sole survivor of Haven Hope, a Resistance Haven in Newfoundland."

DescriptionEntry="FNORD (Subject to future Edits or a likely rewrite)\n\nThese Hunter-Killer Drones are as much machine as they are Chryssalid. Unlike other known members of The Requiem Legion, these are clearly designed to be disposal units, as their design shows no care for maintaining the lifespan of the base Alien. Capable of reaching running speeds measured at approximately a hundred and ninety kilometers a hour, with claws and mandibles that can tear apart steel with astonishing ease, a bomb built into their backsides, and the ability to detonate nearby explosives with a pulse of Psionic energy from their implanted devices, these Nightmares serve as the Aliens' equivalent of Landmines. \n\n- From The Report on The Requiem Legion, compiled by The Intelligence Officer, Captain Audrey Bellamy and Psionic Field Officer and former Psionics Researcher, Sergeant Malin Kell"

DescriptionEntry="FNORD (Subject to future Edits or a likely rewrite)\n\nProxima-B. Once known to the native Proxians as Hulk, now it is mostly a uninhabitable Corroded wasteland of a world. From the few survivors of Proxian Extinction War of Proxima-B, however, we learned of the first known deployment of The Requiem Legion. The Mechtoids are seemingly one of the oldest units of The Elders' Requiem Legion, and were instrumental in the rapid extinction of the Proxian Race. Armed with the infamous Bala'Kor Coring Cannons, massive weapons designed to penetrate the advanced armor and shielding technologies of The Proxians with ease. Like other known Requiem Armaments, the energies utilized in these Mechtoids' weapons are seemingly antithetical to life itself.\n\nDisregarding their horrific Coring Cannons, however, these Mechtoids extremely dangerous War Machines in their own right. Utilizing a Sectoid's still living amputated head as an integral part of their computerized systems, these war marchines are also able to wield formidable Psionic powers against the enemies of the Elders, some even being capable of outright mind control. According to some of the more sensitive Psionics in the Resistance, if you concentrate and try to feel the presence of their minds, you can still hear the Sectoids in these machines, screaming in their own heads. \n\n- From The Report on The Requiem Legion, compiled by The Intelligence Officer, Captain Audrey Bellamy and Psionic Field Officer and former Psionics Researcher, Sergeant Malin Kell"

DescriptionEntry="FNORD (Subject to future Edits or a likely rewrite)\n\nThese newer variations of the Alien constructs known as Archons, nicknames as Angelics, are notedly reported to be very feminine and surprisingly beautiful by some of XCOM's younger and more suicidal new recruits, who have been given an extremely stern warning that must be included in this informational log by orders of Central Officer Bradford after the disastrous failure of Operation Crimson Vandal, for more information see the details of the report on Operation Crimson Vandal, Everything That Went Wrong With The Third Gene Therapy Clinic Infiltration and Sabotage Operation in New Paris. To transcribe the warning in a more polite manner I quote, 'Under no circumstances are you to attempt to seduce the damn Aliens, that you should be paying attention to the size of their damn weapons, and not the size of their damn breasts.' Also included in the warnings given to the recruits was that Central Officer Bradford swore that while the recruits are free to commit suicide on their own time, he would personally throw the next person who attempted to seduce an alien while deployed on a mission out of the Avenger's airlock. \n\nTo members of ADVENT's Elder Cult, The Angelics are heralded as divine messengers of The Elders, and are most often witnessed in various public events together with ADVENT's Clergy, conducting sermons, blessings, and various other religious rituals. While their more Clerical Role and developing significance is deeply integrated into ADVENT's Propaganda Efforts, these Aliens remain extremely dangerous, as some of them are capable of Psionic Abilities, and all of them equipped with unique variants of the Aliens' Requiem Armaments. With their Primary weapons being various forms of Combat Staves, these Angelics are also equipped with a hidden Artillery System, which launches a barrage of highly explosive chemical laden munitions at nearby targets. \n\n- From The Report on The Requiem Legion, compiled by The Intelligence Officer, Captain Audrey Bellamy and Psionic Field Officer and former Psionics Researcher, Sergeant Malin Kell"

On the other hand, however, their innards are a mass of writhing flesh and nanomachines, designed to serve as a gestation chamber and nanofactory, to manufacture and deploy the Aliens' infamous Nightmares at a rapid speed, seeding the land with fast moving subterrainean living landmines. \n\n- From The Report on The Requiem Legion, compiled by The Intelligence Officer, Captain Audrey Bellamy and Psionic Field Officer and former Psionics Researcher, Sergeant Malin Kell"

[RequiemHinter X2UFOpediaTemplate]
DescriptionEntry="First witnessed by our Templar Liaison, Cloista The Shadowblade, our Most Veteran Field Officer, Major Gruffle, our finest Tech Specialist, Major Dport, and our most trigger happy Marine, who thankfully managed to refrain from firing, a certain Captain Stukov. While out on a covert expedition for The Templars, they witnessed a shadowy figure vanish into the dark of night, leaving no traces of its presence. While initially dismissed as a Spectre, while reviewing the footage recorded by our team, we discovered she was something else entirely. Oddly enough, however, she fit the description of a strange rumor I had heard on the Resistance Radio. The Hinters, shadowy, sensual Alien figures that could disappear around corners and appear from thin air. Strange Alien Women that would visit people in the middle of the night and grant them a night to remember, or make them disappear forever. \n\nOf course, for having opened my big mouth about the rumors, I got assigned together with Senior Intelligence Officer Abizi and Colonel Tedster, to perform a follow up investigation and interrogation of The Resistance Radio's DJ about the rumored Hinters. Thankfully he cooperated without much trouble, under the condition that we allow him to conduct a small interview with some of the Heroes of The Resistance. Naturally, of course, I agreed, though my superiors seemed hesitant for some reason. Afterwards, Radio DJ provided us with a strange journal, written by a certain Francois Dubois, a former XCOM-Affiliated Psionic, and a Researcher who worked under Doctor Vahlen as part of her Psionics Program. Between deranged illustrations and writings of nonsensical gibberish and how it explained certain functions of the ADVENT Psionic Network, he wrote of a mysterious and curvaceous woman, with skin like shadows, patterns in her skin that glowed a beautiful pinkish-red, and an immensely sultry voice, appearing out of the mirror on nights of a full moon.\n\nAt first, he was terrified, but the woman never tried to hurt him, instead, she seemed all too eager to ask him questions about his work. Though initially suspicious, after her fifth visitation, he asked her if he was going mad, or if she was real. After having declared herself as being a Hinter, and that she was as real as the night sky, a series of unnecessarily lurid details about a romantic tryst with the woman followed. Summarizing the details of the following visits for the sake of Chief Engineer Shen, despite Doctor Tygan's insistence that every detail about the woman could be a clue, of particular note was that the woman often asked him intensely inspiring and thought provoking questions about his Psionics Research, which he answered. Eventually, the journal ends on January Twenty First, Twenty Thirty Four, after describing the details of an intensely pasionate night with the woman, after having successfully answered her latest questions.\n\nWhich is why I, along with Senior Officer Abizi, and Colonel Tedster, ended up being dispatched by Central Ass Bradford on a miserable three week expedition to locate a ruined Resistance Haven in Mazovia, Poland.. In the middle of winter. Which of course, I greatly protested. Not that he cared, and Firebrand dumped us off in the middle of nowhere at his orders, during a blizzard. After two weeks digging through ruins, Colonel Tedster finally gave the order that we make a visit to the relatively nearby Reaper Outpost. After a three day trek, which rewarded us with a warm room for an evening and a cup of hot cocoa that was simply divine, they allowed Senior Officer Abizi to dig through their intel archives in exchange for the information on what we were investigating.\n\n To our great surprise though, they had a dossier on Francois Dubois from the year prior. He was, for a short while, a person of interest to The Reapers after he claimed to have been visited by a strange and shapely alien woman in the middle of the night, who inquired about his Psionics Research. After repeated reports of visitations, and no evidence of her comings and goings or her existence, he was eventually dismissed as having gone insane. Until January Twenty Second, Twenty Thirty Four, when his daughter, Viviane, reported his mysterious disappearance without a trace, as well as a deeply unsettling and eerie painting on his bedroom walls.\n\nNo further evidence of anything was uncovered, much less of any alien involvement, or even any evidence towards the existence of The Hinters or what they're capable of. Which of course, Central Ass Bradford complained about. Though we returned with images of the painting and the Journal, the painting remained completely undecipherable, Doctor Tygan and Senior Psi Officer, Malin Kell, concluded that while there are no current benefits to our Psionics Program from the immense amount of data and research in the Journal, it remains extremely valuable for research. Supposedly, as a former Psionics Researcher and Doctor Vahlen's right hand woman, Malin is working with Tygan to decipher and catalogue the information in the Journal, but with how often they're locking everyone else in the Psionics Team out of the lab late at night, I'd bet my third ration bar sure she's just sleeping with Tygan.\n\n- From the Personal Log of Junior Psi Officer, Sergeant Keres 'Whippersnapper' Durand"
